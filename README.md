# Description

Design a multi-page web application interface to apply your HTML and CSS skills. Your application should include:

Dashboard/Homepage with a clear layout that presents summary information, navigation, and any relevant interactive components.

User Profile Page where profile information is presented and styled with forms for potential user input.

Settings or Preferences Page with toggles or checkboxes to showcase different user options.

Focus on building responsive layouts, using flexbox or grid for structure, and experimenting with hover effects, modals, and smooth transitions for interactive elements. This project will demonstrate your ability to design a clean, user-friendly web application interface.

NOTE: This does not need to be functional on the back-end. This is solely front-end development.
